  - [ ] Implement max Energy and HP/damage limits
  - [x] Possibly rework how Tools that apply statuses work?
    - [x] Current bug: Eevee with Leaf Cape evolving into Leafeon will not gain HP
  - [ ] Some properties on `PlayerPokemonView` can be maliciously modified by agents—use `.slice()` and make deep copies
  - [x] Parsing logic is duplicated across different parsing files; there's probably a way to combine all the natural language parsing into one method
  - [ ] A lot of the reactive logic that I'm currently hard-coding could possibly be simplified by switching everything to Vue's `ref`/`computed`/`watch`
    - Biggest downside I see with this approach is maintaining order-of-operations (OOO) becomes much trickier to keep track of (for example, every action _must_ be logged before the relevant property is modified)
    - Callbacks still feel like a better approach for things like knockouts which happen out of sequence with the property they're related to (can't just do `watch(hp, (val) => { if (val == 0) ... })`)
    - I also don't know if this will be faster or slower than the callback approach, but I would guess slower at first glance
- [ ] Logging improvements
  - [ ] Add increase/decrease max HP log events (probably does not need to be separate)
  - [ ] If damage prevention came from somewhere other than the afflicted mon, log it (e.g. Comfey)
  - [ ] Log the specific Special Condition prevented instead of just "a Special Condition"
  - [ ] Prevent "played to bench" event from appearing as a player action when it was a side effect
- [ ] Interactions to test in-app
  - [ ] Heavy Helmet vs CounterAttack status effect (does it reduce damage? Reddit claims it will)
  - [ ] Heavy Helmet vs max HP damage (990 or 970?)
- [x] Single battle simulation
- [ ] Basic logic-based AI opponent (at least as competitive as Auto Mode)
  - [ ] Evolve multiple mon per turn
  - [ ] Avoid putting down multiple of the same mon if others are available
  - [ ] Properly calculate energy costs for attacking
  - [ ] Why is the bot not switching into mon that are ready to attack?
- [x] Mass battle simulation
- [ ] Deck fine-tuning via iteration
